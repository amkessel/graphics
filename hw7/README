CSCI 5229 Homework 6 (Textures)
10/20/2011

Time to complete: ~15 hours (I spent WAY too much time searching for decent textures!!!)

General usage (mostly the same as the lighting example):

'x' to toggle axes
'0' snaps angles to 0,0
arrows to rotate the world
PgUp/PgDn zooms in/out
+/- changes field of view of perspective
F1 toggles light distance (1/5)
'l' toggles lighting
a/A decrease/increase ambient light
d/D decrease/increase diffuse light
s/S decrease/increase specular light
e/E decrease/increase emitted light
n/N decrease/increase shininess
m  toggles light movement
[] lower/rise light

Notes:
1. There are some warnings from compilation. However, these are in loadtexbmp.c because I am compiling with g++. Vlakkies said this was okay.
2. This model is of a variant of the Millenium Falcon in Star Wars. I tried to do the real one, and had all the geometry computed, but could not find decent textures aside from this variant, so I decided to go with this.
3. The thrust area has a non-black emissivity, so turning the ambient light all the way down (lowercase 'a') showcases that nicely when looking at the back.
4. I think mapping texture coordinates are much harder than computing lighting normals!
